      /*
      the basic idea of rotation based on speed is using the two speeds as your triangles to get 
      an angle using sin cos and tan. In this case I googled how to do it and this is what I found. you can 
      use the Math.atan2 to get the angle from the two speeds, using y first and x second. why arctan squared?
      I have no clue at all, from what I can tell it's some kind of math or something. who knows. anyway you 
      use that to get your angle in radians and then you suffer through rotation. rotation stinks, all my homies
      hate rotation. just keep changing things around with the rotation until something works, and the second
      it works stop messing with it so it doesn't break. I hate it so much. Also take a note that I have some friction
      that only happens when they bounce and some gravity going on, so that's something.
