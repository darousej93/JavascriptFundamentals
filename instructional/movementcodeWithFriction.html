		so friction code is made up of three parts for each speed, for a total of six parts.
		the basic friction code is just xspeed = xspeed - friction. Obviously all this does is slow down 
		the speed by reducing it by a small ammount every frame. However if your speed is negative, subtracting will 
		only speed you up. Therefore you must first check if your speed is positive or negative. However, once you get
		this working you introduce an additional problem. If you are always slowing down then you never actually stop. Even if your
		speed is zero, it will be subtracted. What we do for that is say, if your speed is less than some small ammount, say .5, then just stop. 

		The actual code works like this
			if( speed is greater than .5, it must be positive){
				then subtract 1 from speed to slow it down
			}
			if (it is less than -.5, it must be negative){
				then add 1 to it to slow it down 
			}else if it is neither above .5 nor below -.5 then it must be inbetween -.5 and .5{
				then just change the speed to 0 so it stops. 
			}

			To better understand how this works, I suggest you change the friction boundry to 0, which will be the same
			as not having it at all, then change friction to 3 or above to really see the effects.

			Note that having a friction boundry higher than the speed means you won't be able to move.
