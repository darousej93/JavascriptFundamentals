		  each time we loop we are taking the deck[deckLength] card, 
		  deckLength being the var counting from 50 to zero,
		  we are taking that card and swapping it with a random card.
		  since we are counting down, that deck[deckLength] card won't be touched again,
		  since the next time it will be looking at the card below that card.
		  the real stroke of genius is that the math.random function will be looking for
